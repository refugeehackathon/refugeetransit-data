Earlier updates: Team of volunteers "SOS Budapest - Bamako" is accepting donations for Zakany, contact them at https://www.facebook.com/Budapest-Bamako-SOS-Refugee-161590304178147, where you also can see what is needed there.

Food situation can change anytime. Apart from local volunteers, French, Israeli and English ones are present onsite. Nice police today. WATER IS NEEDED.

It has been reported that foreigner groups don't understand what the loudspeakers tell them and it is a problem. 

During the weekdays volunteers ARE needed and weekdays nights in particular. Zakany also needs volunteers for days starting Friday 16/10

Police and soldiers don't like volunteers' presence just when they're working at trains.

Refugees get here by train from Croatia.  The soldiers went to the volunteers and thanked them the help and for how human they were...
There are varying amount of volunteers waiting for the refugees. Trains usually leave every 3-4 hours with at least 1400 refugees on each train and they head to Hegyeshalom. Police is around, both nice and shouting. From the border people walk, board trains and then volunteers are allowed to deliver water and food.

 Inforamtion about times of arrival of special trains from Tovarnik to Botovo/Zakany are published on twitter account of Croatian government - https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=hu&amp;sl=hr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FVladaRH

4000 people were on the way to Opatovac via buses early morning 23/10. Camp was reported almost full evening of 22/10. 

Many buses have gone from the camp to Slovenian borders, and people continue being delivered to Tovarnik to take trains.
About 500-800 people inside "green" sector waiting to be delivered to Tovarnik train station by buses. Situation is very calm.

Around 1500 people in the camp at night.

UNHCR got 15 pallets of blankets. CRC gave 2 of it to volunteers to distribute.

During last hrs. we got the chance to clean up a really messy tent, so MAGNA may use it as a mother/child shelter and rest room again at least tomorrow evening.
      
By now enough volunteers (about 20) on site, if situation stays like this.
Newcomers were brought from Bapska directly to Tovarnik train station. 

Situation in Opatovac may change immediately, if authorities decide to bring people not directly to train station anymore.

As cold as 4°C at night.

Croatian prime minister said no one will be held in camp for more than 24 hours and no one will be driven to the Hungarian border (Beremend). Trains go to Botovo border crossing. Opatovac camp is the hotspot for now, locate some volunteers in the area and get the most updated info.

Volunteers traveling via Hungary/Serbia and Croatia/Serbia border crossings are experiencing problems at the Serbian customs offices, which does not want to let them in the country without paying custom duties and declarations. Shoes, clothes and large quantities of food are also problem. Always try to reduce amount of aid you carry so it does not seem suspicious, also try to pretend you are not aid workers but just tourists. Cover supplies with your personal belonging and luggage. In case of problems, there is a possibility to leave your supplies at Tovarnik at Croatian side, but the size is limited. Use Tovarnik/Sid border crossing. 

Refugees came by foot to the nobody’s land from Sid. They could get food through a Christian team.

Refugees are registered here and taken directly to Hungarian border. From midnight to 6 am buses are taking refugees to Opatovac camp.

Many of the NGOs left. Last night 1500 refugees slept at Berkasovo in tents/blankets. Large groups of hundreds of refugees come for a few hours then leave for Croatia. Police on Croatian side quite nervous and forbidding some volunteers to help.<br><br>Bapska 4:30 CET 23/10: Police allowed volunteers  to build a hotspot to cook tea and give out some food by using a mobile kitchen. <br><br>Berkasovo 23:01 CET: borders have been closed the last days until 6 a.m. Nobody is allowed to walk. Only buses are legal. Donations cannot be brought across the border without customs documentation.<br>Temperature is around 0°C. <br><br>The border tends to be open throughout the day but closes at night, which makes the nights extremely rough.<br><br>Place for children to play with has been set up and also some musicians appeared.<br><br>Refugees are bused from Presevo or Belgrade 300 m before the CR border and pass numerous stands of various Serbian and international humanitarian aid groups and initiatives, mostly coordinated by Czech volunteers.<br><br>At the CR border, they go through couple of big military tents lined and attached together in case of bigger queue and rain and after the tents immediately there's a bus turning point where police escorts them to buses heading to Opatovac(for registration with very rare fingerprinting, and eventually some rest or medical treatment), usually in 2 lines, or sometimes in 1 line, always giving advantage to the most needed. In case of urgent medical cases police calls ER ambulance and they dispatch those people ASAP to Opatovac or further (Vukovar hospital, etc.).<br><br>Red Cross, Operation Mercy, World Vision, MSF and UNHCR onsite.

						<value>Tense situation on the Serbian side, nights worse than days, very cold. Many of the NGOs left. Last night 1500 refugees slept at Berkasovo in tents/blankets. Large groups of hundreds of refugees come for a few hours then leave for Croatia. Police on Croatian side quite nervous and forbidding some volunteers to help.

Bapska 4:30 CET 23/10: Police allowed volunteers  to build a hotspot to cook tea and give out some food by using a mobile kitchen. 

Berkasovo 23:01 CET: borders have been closed the last days until 6 a.m. Nobody is allowed to walk. Only buses are legal. Donations cannot be brought across the border without customs documentation.
Temperature is around 0°C. 

The border tends to be open throughout the day but closes at night, which makes the nights extremely rough.

Place for children to play with has been set up and also some musicians appeared.

Refugees are bused from Presevo or Belgrade 300 m before the CR border and pass numerous stands of various Serbian and international humanitarian aid groups and initiatives, mostly coordinated by Czech volunteers.

At the CR border, they go through couple of big military tents lined and attached together in case of bigger queue and rain and after the tents immediately there's a bus turning point where police escorts them to buses heading to Opatovac(for registration with very rare fingerprinting, and eventually some rest or medical treatment), usually in 2 lines, or sometimes in 1 line, always giving advantage to the most needed. In case of urgent medical cases police calls ER ambulance and they dispatch those people ASAP to Opatovac or further (Vukovar hospital, etc.).

Red Cross, Operation Mercy, World Vision, MSF and UNHCR onsite. RC is not caring about the situation as it should.

Police very helpful. <br><br>Two Arabic translators on site now but no farsi. Less tea and food was given out than previous days so quite a few people at back of queue were quite hungry. Cleaning crew did a cleanup around 3 am. Taxi drivers did business all night. <br><br>A large room and apparently an apartment got rented out by German volunteers. The room is right beside the queue and reserved for women mainly with children, but also a few fathers, maybe about 70-100 pax. Many families sleeping on the side of the road. No doctors present between 6-9 although that's been quite a crucial time. Expecting more refugees tonight.<br><br>Sometimes long, unexplained breaks between trains. There are opportunities to break, rest, reorganize between the trains. It takes about 45 minutes after a train arrive for 90% of the people to be gone.<br><br>If the toilet system becomes full, the WC is locked until a truck can come to empty it.<br><br>Tabanovce is the last place in Macedonia 1.5 km to the Serbian border.. <br><br>Slanishte, in Tabanovtse, is a small transit camp. People arrive on trains and rest before going 1500m across Serbian border. From there, busses take them to Miratovac where volunteers are not allowed. There are some volunteers at Tabanovce, but most leave at night. It can be hard to find this place, and especially intimidating at night, as it's off a small road, there is a gate, and the train station workers can be quite offputting and you may have to park outside the gate and walk in. There are toilets/washrooms, phone charging, UNHCR shelters, and Red Cross doctors.<br><br>The walk to Serbia is not easy, and is EXTREMELY difficult with small children or the elderly.<br><br>Supply needs: Rain coats, hats, 240L garbage bags (for rain ponchos), large rolls of plastic sheeting that can be made into rain ponchos, SOCKS!!!<br><br>Good places to go shopping:<br>-Bazaars in Skopje- Have socks for cheap. About 20 dinar / pari, but you may be able to negotiate a lower price for quantity. Be prepared to pay in cash.<br>-Intermall/Intergros in Illinden- Random stuff. Small stuffed bears for 40 dinar/each. Pavilion tents for about €60-80. http://maps.google.com/?cid=11226586517482926442&hl=en&gl=us<br>Volunteer need: More volunteers at night would be great, since all UNHCR and most Red Cross go home. We arrived late at night and there were only about 7 (including us) to handle trainloads of 500-1000 people wanting warm clothes, shoes, and ponchos. Crowd control becomes an issue.

					<Data name='Situation'>
						<value>A7 7:00 CET no more people coming but still a very long line 100 meters long, moving forward slowly but steadily in batches of about 40-50 people every 20 minutes or so. Police very helpful. 

Two Arabic translators on site now but no farsi. Less tea and food was given out than previous days so quite a few people at back of queue were quite hungry. Cleaning crew did a cleanup around 3 am. Taxi drivers did business all night. 

A large room and apparently an apartment got rented out by German volunteers. The room is right beside the queue and reserved for women mainly with children, but also a few fathers, maybe about 70-100 pax. Many families sleeping on the side of the road. No doctors present between 6-9 although that's been quite a crucial time. Expecting more refugees tonight.

Sometimes long, unexplained breaks between trains. There are opportunities to break, rest, reorganize between the trains. It takes about 45 minutes after a train arrive for 90% of the people to be gone.

If the toilet system becomes full, the WC is locked until a truck can come to empty it.

Tabanovce is the last place in Macedonia 1.5 km to the Serbian border.. 

Slanishte, in Tabanovtse, is a small transit camp. People arrive on trains and rest before going 1500m across Serbian border. From there, busses take them to Miratovac where volunteers are not allowed. There are some volunteers at Tabanovce, but most leave at night. It can be hard to find this place, and especially intimidating at night, as it's off a small road, there is a gate, and the train station workers can be quite offputting and you may have to park outside the gate and walk in. There are toilets/washrooms, phone charging, UNHCR shelters, and Red Cross doctors.

The walk to Serbia is not easy, and is EXTREMELY difficult with small children or the elderly.

						<value>Rain coats, hats, 240L garbage bags (for rain ponchos), large rolls of plastic sheeting that can be made into rain ponchos, SOCKS!!!

Good places to go shopping:
-Bazaars in Skopje- Have socks for cheap. About 20 dinar / pari, but you may be able to negotiate a lower price for quantity. Be prepared to pay in cash.
-Intermall/Intergros in Illinden- Random stuff. Small stuffed bears for 40 dinar/each. Pavilion tents for about €60-80. http://maps.google.com/?cid=11226586517482926442&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us</value>

					<Data name='Volunteer need'>
						<value>More volunteers at night would be great, since all UNHCR and most Red Cross go home. We arrived late at night and there were only about 7 (including us) to handle trainloads of 500-1000 people wanting warm clothes, shoes, and ponchos. Crowd control becomes an issue. The most needed time for volunteers is 12am-7am.

situation really bad right now. No buses are running from the transit places connected to the beaches because the camps are over capacity which makes the situation unbearable in the small villages.

It's not possible to give all the help the refugees need, risk of separating families, hypothermia, dead bodies coming with boats or floating to shore and even a woman giving birth with only volunteers to help.

Families are sleeping outside and the weather conditions and also restrictions on boats leaving in the day makes the trips even more dangerous as so many people come by night and wet and cold. 

Skala Sikamineas has been reported as the major landing spot for boats at this moment.

Most of the times refugees arrive completely wet, so it's a good thing they can change their clothes when they get to the island.

Refugees' route is up to the smugglers, When people started arriving in 2014 Tilos received more refugees than Kos  and Kos people sent supply needs to the sister island.

Till 5-6 weeks ago there was a continuous stream of refugees arriving on Tilos. Then it stopped and nothing since. Local people believe because police caught many of the smugglers this year. For refugees it's cheaper to buy a space in a rubber boat than it is to be brought by a smuggler in a safer boat Emoticon frown and more dangerous. 

Currently, Tilos is not on refugees' route but nobody knows when smugglers will change it again.

But still all refugees are allowed to transit through Sweden.<br><br>Who is heading to Norway and Finland choose not to register. Sweden offers asylum to all Syrians. Many Iraqis and Eritreans arrived too. Who registers in the Swedish reception centers, stays there for up to a year. The process takes time. Most reception centers have good standards (not tents, etc). Only registered ones as asylum seekers get shelter from the Swedish authorities while their applications are processed. Refugees can stay on their own while the application process is going on but they are just helped by local volunteers.

						<value>The migration board is trying harder to uphold the Schengen treaty and therefore it is sometimes harder to help the refugees get to the sleeping places. But still all refugees are allowed to transit through Sweden.

Who is heading to Norway and Finland choose not to register. Sweden offers asylum to all Syrians. Many Iraqis and Eritreans arrived too. Who registers in the Swedish reception centers, stays there for up to a year. The process takes time. Most reception centers have good standards (not tents, etc). Only registered ones as asylum seekers get shelter from the Swedish authorities while their applications are processed. Refugees can stay on their own while the application process is going on but they are just helped by local volunteers. Many refugees seek asylum in Stockholm and Gothenburg. 

Who seeks asylum in Sweden is free to go everywhere.

ALL refugees get free health care too without having to register in Sweden if they want to go to Norway or Finland. A clinic is helping everyone. See at http://www.skane.se/webbplatser/primarvarden_skane/vardcentraler/vara-vardcentraler/malmo/malmo---sodervarn/

Don't give out clothes in Miljana, just blankets and jacket - if that - because if you slow people down police are not happy with that

If you are in nearby, please check the situation, this may be dangerous to have lot of people in the middle of the night without ANY help.
